# TinamouAudioClassifier
## Software and tools requirment
Github, VSCODE, Python

In the Audio_Classification_by_Nilesh_Fonseka ipynb file I have converted the audio files in "Audio" to CSV for latter use. if the ipynb is used to run alone ignore that because I have uploaded the relevant csv to "Audio_samples"

make sure to replace the file paths correctly if ipynb is used

Test_Nilesh_Fonseka is used to test the 3 audio files using the saved model "DLmodel.h5"
